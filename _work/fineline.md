## Overview
My project, **FineLine**, is a robot teammate that **reduces the mental workload of professional chefs by reimagining the order ticketing system, was presented for the HOT Ed Design Challenge hosted by the Gettyâ€™s Group Company for the Hotel of Tomorrow Project**, a design summit for the future of hospitality. In this semester-long project, I, in a group of 3, learned to analyze videos of interactions, created storyboards to outline desired interactions, and participated in design reviews. As we identified from our field observations, at Cornell's Statler Hotel, we saw that head chefs were tasked with doing repetitive physical tasks when managing the ticketing system, our project looked to alleviate this point.

### Prototype
I created, using a combination of CAD, 3D printing, and electrical skills, a mechatronic system that showcased the desired functionality of our final product. We designed specifically for 3 different cases: [allowing chefs to multitask while receiving new orders](https://github.com/nnamd/nnamd.github.io/blob/main/img/step1.gif), [auto-updating the order status of a ticket on the line](https://github.com/nnamd/nnamd.github.io/blob/main/img/step1.gif), and [correcting the ticket line for lost tickets](https://github.com/nnamd/nnamd.github.io/blob/main/img/step1.gif). Videos for each interaction can be seen in the linked videos prior.
