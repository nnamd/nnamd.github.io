### Abstract

Underwater manipulation tasks require precise manipulator and vehicle control to safely complete tasks like environmental sampling and dock maintenance. As underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMS) are subject to complex hydrodynamic motions, UVMS must account for any undesired dynamic changes or external forces that occur during a manipulation task. In this paper, we propose an admittance control law that uses measured end-effector forces to determine the compliant motion required to minimize interaction forces. With this approach, we demonstrate, both in simulation and hardware, results for compliant motion of a manipulator that minimizes interaction forces.

Cornell Autonomous Bicycle is a project team at Cornell Unversity that I was apart of from February 2020 to my graduation in May 2022. The primary goal of the team was to create a bike capable of self-balancing itself without use of external componenets like a flywheel. The mechanaical sub-team, to which I was apart of, was looking to create a new bicycle for the term I had joined and by the time I left, we had completed all the necessary components for the bikes. I was directly responsible for the design and buildout of 12 parts on the bike and worked in a group of 1-3 (ranging throughout the years) to develop and eventually manufacture the parts my senior year. In my senior year, I co-led the subteam, improved our internal documentation practices, and looked to support the design skills of our members by engaging with new projects.

Further design details of our work (and the team at large) can be seen at the [Cornell Autonomous Bicycle wiki](http://ec2-18-223-29-116.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/wiki/index.php/The_New_Bike)
