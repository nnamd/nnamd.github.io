## Overview
The main problem statement that Ergocon served to answer was "How might we design a wearable input device for digital modeling in a VR environment that helps **reduce fatigue** from long-term usage and **improve input efficiency and accuracy** without visual aid

In a group of 4, I worked to create our control scheme. This led me to actively looking at competitors to compare current control interfaces and how they operated to which I would relay back to our team. After identifying what types of control we needed for our system, I **created a circuit schematic and accompanying PCB layout** in Eagle that enabled our prototype to achieve all of its desired functionality for initial testing. 

Our work culminated in a 40-page product specification document that detailed rationale of product market fit, engineering characteristics, design iterations, and manufacturing processes and costs.
