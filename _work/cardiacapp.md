## Abstract
 The purpose of the app is in documenting cardiac arrest where cardiac arrest. In current hospitals there aren’t many if any formal ways to collect this information and is very often just written on paper which can cause the potential for the possibility of steps or the entire process not being properly documented. Our app tries to solve this by stepping through the formal Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) or Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Algorithm (PALS). There are essentially sets of paths you’d want to follow depending on the Age of the person having cardiac arrest or the type. I collaborated with 2 medical professionals to work on the app. 

## Technical Contributions
The App Itself was built with the **Flutter Framework and Dart**. I created the full-stack. The backend was created using **Python** with **FlaskSQL**, a NoSQL database enabled us to do manage user sessions, save information, and in the future pair with organizations. We’re currently hosting the servers for the app on Google Cloud Run, but we’ll likely transition to a Docker Image (on a VM) with AWS later on or Elastic Beanstalk. The app itself already has a **Docker** implementation.
