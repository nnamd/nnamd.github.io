## Who Am I?

My name is **Nnamdi Nwagwu**. I am currently a Robotics PhD Student at Oregon State University. I work in the SHARE Lab under Dr. Naomi Fitter and am designing studies to explore the use of transformative sound for robots. I recently graduated with my Bachelors of Science from Cornell University in Mechanical Engineering where I was able to build the technical skills I hope to apply and develop in my research. Beyond acadaemia, video editing and drawing are hobbies of mine I'd love to incoorporate in my future career asprations.
